### Hi! 👋 

My name is Jonas, and I work as a manager on the research team at SpecterOps. I'm a passionate security professional who enjoys diving into real and imaginary problems across the offensive and defensive landscape. I spend my days researching attack techniques and translating them into graph models within [BloodHound](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound).

Before joining SpecterOps, I worked as a security consultant, helping organizations harden their Active Directory and Windows environments. I bring practical experience from defending (and breaking) enterprise systems, including implementing security measures like AD tiering, Protected Users, IPSec, and NTLM hardening.
